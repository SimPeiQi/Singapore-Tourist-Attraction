            <p></p>This is a not to be missed experience with great attractions to see.
            The aquariums are amazing with all sorts of river creatures. Not to be missed as the pandas of course,
            Always a treat to see these wonderful animals. Well worth the visit

            <p></p>Many walkways are covered so you are not in the baking sun.
            The 2.30 pm animal show was booked out by the time we arrived, but we did what the notice said and waited
            by the show entrance for seats to be released just before show time because of no-shows that had booked online.
            The boat ride was an extra $5.00 which was a bit pricey, but you could ride more than once for no extra cost.
            You must get off the boat and go back into the queue which was fine because it was not busy.
            The animal enclosures are large and clean, and where possible natural barriers are used instead of cages.

            <p></p>We came here to see the pandas, knowing that we wouldn't be able to actually go on
            the boat ride (our daughter was too short), but the kids still had a good time looking at all the sea creatures
            and the pandas (which we also enjoyed). We did miss out on a few animals by missing the boat ride though.

            <p></p>Loved the experience! Park is well set out and signposted. Lots of interesting facts about the animals displayed at regular intervals.
            Very helpful and informative staff. Sandra (one of the keepers) took a few minutes to tell us about how they care for the fish. Would highly recommend.

            <p></p>Very nice tour. The enclosure don't seem too small for the animals. The pandas were a marvel to watch...
            Get there early so the temperature is not too bad.

            <p></p>I am baffled by the negative reviews -- obviously, the River Wonders area will only have river-related animals?
            So of course it is smaller than the zoo or the bird park? You need to take that into consideration when you go.
            That being said -- it is still a wonderful park, it will just only take 2-3 hours to go through instead of the 6-7 of the bird park.
            The squirrel monkey exhibit is incredible and you can walk through the enclosure. They have giant river otters, pandas, a huge manatee exhibit,
            a boat ride -- it's a blast. I highly recommend it as a 2-3 hour excursion!

            <p></p>Very small, underwhelming, overpriced park. The boat ride was down for maintenance so we were unable to see some of the animals.
            The park was quiet when I visited, but the only remaining show was somehow overbooked so we also couldn’t attend the show.
            There is very little else to see, we walked round the rest of the park in about 30mins. Only one panda was visible,
            the other panda enclosure had a sign up saying it was ‘shy’ but could be viewed in its hide via a live camera shown on the screen.
            The screen was switched off.

            <p></p>main attraction is the pandas and thats definitely the best part.
            basically a walking trail with a bunch of fish tanks placed around,
            the boat ride is an extra $5 per person and you can only get tickets online,
            wish i saved my $5 it was not very good. it was not crowded when we went so entire visit was done in just over an hour.
            if you happy to pay the price to see some pandas and hope they arent sleeping then its fine.

            <p></p>A fun day out at the River Wonders area of the zoo. The trail was organised and easy to follow with a nice mix
            of outdoor and indoor exhibits. Very clean and the animals look very well cared for. I would really recommend the Amazon river quest ride too.
            Food a little pricey and not the best quality and this is the only area where I could see an improvement to be made.

            <p></p>Fabulous and interesting day out. It rained a bit and the area was very well sheltered.
            We spent a few hours exploring and found it very well set out with fabulous keepers.

            <p></p>This is a smaller zoo near the Singapore zoo, with a few different animals. The best part is the panda area,
            which had some red pandas too. Definitely worth the visit just for the pandas, since they’re not that common.
            Apart from that, there’s also some other animals and an aquarium.

            <p></p>Good exhibits and creatively show the different river systems of the world.
            Have to pay extra ($5) for the 10-minute Boat Adventure.
            Would probably recommend just going to the Sentosa Aquarium for the price though

            <p></p>Excellent and engaging animal show involving capybaras - we were super stoked about it.
            Tip: Book your slot in the morning of your visit as slots fill up really quickly!
            Appreciate the general narrative of animal/nature conservation and educating the next generation.
            Did not manage to see the pandas except Kaikai.

            <p></p>It's a long walk from the carpark to the River Wonders entrance, and once inside,
            the sign-posting is nowhere near as good as in other Singapore attractions.
            The boat ride is mediocre and the show is average. However, there is a wide variety of fauna and fish,
            but with the Zoo and Aquarium in Singapore, this attraction is superfluous and very expensive.

            <p></p>Place is easy to get to. With mrt stop at boon lay and go to pick up area to continue with the shuttle bus.
            I bought the ticket at klook but just for admission only, so for the boat ride we need to buy a ticket 10SGD for each person.

            <p></p>The entrance fee for adults varies from $38-$40 (depending are u a citizen or foreigner). I'm a Singaporean so I paid $38.
            Went on a long weekend, the 11.30am show was snapped up very fast at it have limited seats due to pandemic.
            The exhibits are a waste of time. Once u go in, go straight to the Giant Pandas, if not it will be long queue.

            <p></p>Having visited Singapore Zoo and Night Safari numerous times, River Wonder is just average experience.
            After the long pandemic lockdown, things seems to have gone rusty. There were lesser staff on duty and with
            that there were lax in crowd control and systematic ushering of visitors around.
            There were extremely long long queues for the only food outlet.

            We had a senior with walking stick and Entrance Staff Aidil and Razak assisted us with the rental of the electric scooter seamlessly. Thank you!
            We also totally enjoyed the “Once Upon a River” show. It was Junior Ranger Halim’s first day for the show and he we doing really good while
            co-hosting with Senior Ranger Dinesh. The great show was amazing.
