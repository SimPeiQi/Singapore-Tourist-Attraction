#Front End Development (FED)
This repository contains the project files for the Front End Development (FED) module. Our team has designed and developed responsive front-end web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#Webpage Theme
Our team has chosen to focus on the theme of “Singapore Attractions.” Singapore captivates us as a city-state with a diverse array of attractions, a vibrant cultural scene, and remarkable architecture. Our webpage highlights some of the must-see attractions that showcase the essence of Singapore.
